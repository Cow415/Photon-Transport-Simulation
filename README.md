Composite storage for all work done for photon distribution simulation via MCX. 

Includes:
    Volumte extraction.
    Geometry processing.
    Meshing.
    Simulation.

QPI provides RI by pixels throughout the layers, this repositoty walks through the workflow that process the TIFF matrix into two items, RI matrix and tissue geometry, both will then be used to simulation the photon distribution.
