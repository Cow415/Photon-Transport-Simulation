Repository---Photon Distribution Simulation For OBM Sample Lumination
    """
    This repository contain all work done to simulate photon distribution in a given sample using 
    Monte Carlo Method, and aim to illustrate photon activity within the sample during imaging.
    """

!!! This repo. is cross accessed between VSCode and MatLab !!!

Composite storage for piping sample tiff into MCX. 

Includes Scripts For:
    1. Volume extraction(Python).
    2. Geometry processing(Python).
    3. Meshing(Matab).
    4. Simulation(MatLab).

QPI provides RI by pixels throughout the layers, this repositoty walks through the workflow that process the TIFF matrix into meshable objects, which will then be used to simulation the photon distribution.
