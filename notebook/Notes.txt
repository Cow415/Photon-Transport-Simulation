Photon Monte Carlo simulation

Redbird v MCX
   MCX: high frequency noise, accurate near source
   Redbird: Smooth, diffusive, but fails near source

Recommended steps:
   Voxelize iso2mesh geometry → MCX
   Project MCX fluence onto FEM nodes
   Quantitative error analysis
   Frequency-domain & time-domain
   Inverse reconstruction using Redbird
